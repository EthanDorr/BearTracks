# BearTracks: Interactive Mercer Map Mobile Application

Made with love by the Mercer University Spring 2024 Senior Design Group Team #25. \
This project makes use of the Mapbox Maps SDK Flutter Plugin to create an interactive
mobile navigation experience. \
We encourage any future Mercer University senior design groups to expand upon our work.
